  <p>In our league, winning is like buying a donut. Sometimes you end up with the one with sprinkles, and other times, Ryan wins. Ryan is the group's alarm clock. Necessary, but you really don't want to hear him win.</p>

  <p>Schleter talks like outer space. You know it’s out there, but it doesn’t make any sense.</p>
  <p>Because, in our league drafting  is like being in a drafty room. It's cold, slightly uncomfortable, and Bob's usually asleep somewhere in the corner.</p>
  <p>Which is why they say a fantasy league is like a family. Our family reunions involve a lot of questioning each other's life choices. Especially Schleter's.</p>
  <p>Like Schlete pretending to be deaf at a strip club, it was like playing charades where everyone loses.</p>
  <p>Dave and Schleter in our fantasy league are like coins in a fountain. They make a splash, but they never come back out on top.</p>
  <p>Bob says things so wild when drunk, even his beer is like, 'Man, I need a drink.'</p>
